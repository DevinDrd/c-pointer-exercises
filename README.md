# C Pointer Exercises

In-class C pointer exercises. If not finished, will be due as homework.

## Arrays

### Static arrays

#### Global array
1. Define a structure.
2. Declare a *static* array of structures, outside of any function. What is the type of the array variable?
3. Assign values in a loop.
4. Step through the code with the debugger.

#### Local array
1. Define a structure.
2. Declare a *static* array of structures, inside a function. What is the type of the array variable?
3. Assign values in a loop.
4. Step through the code with the debugger.

### Dynamic arrays

#### Monolithic array
1. Define a structure.
2. Allocate a *dynamic* array of structures. What is the type of the array variable?
3. Assign values in a loop.
4. Free all dynamic memory.
5. Step through the code with the debugger.

#### Array of pointers
1. Define a structure.
2. Allocate a *dynamic* array of **pointers** to structures. What is the type of the array variable?
3. Assign values in a loop.
4. Free all dynamic memory. Mind the order to avoid leaving dangling pointers!
5. Step through the code with the debugger.
